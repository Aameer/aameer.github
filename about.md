> Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder - Rumi

May peace and mercy of Allmighty be on you. This is **Aameer**. I love startups and I am huge fan of entrepreneurs. I have been fortunate enough to be around tech startups for past few years. I love to learn and innovate new things with researchers, hackers and most importantly with dreamers. Coming from beautiful but conflict ridden place viz. [Valley](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Srinagar/@34.1069229,74.6663249,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x38e1855686e3c5ef:0x66244b7cc1e305c6) (not the silicon valley but the one in silly-con-dition) I had hard time figuring out things by myself. 

It was during that period open source community helped me a lot and by this blog I want to contribute and be a part of this amazing revolution. I will be sharing many things  mostly technical in nature or related to startups, which may or maynot be helpful to anyone facing similar kind of problems. Moreover, I also forget many things so these posts will also serve as a future refrence for me.

Thank god  you are not bored to death, so I hope you will keep testing your patience with me and keep on following my posts. Apart from computers I love travelling, eating, sports and making new friends, so do contact me if you feel so. I also write about some other intresting stuff on my [medium blog](https://medium.com/@aameer).
