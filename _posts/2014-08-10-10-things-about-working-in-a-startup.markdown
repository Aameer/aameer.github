It has been almost  a year since I joined a tech startup in Hyderabad, India.I will try to summarise few things which I have learnt during this  period.Although a Startup for different people may mean different things, for some it means “living a dream” and for some “living in a dream”. For most of the people associated with a startup (incliuding myself) Lean Startup is the best introduction of this amazing world, but I will not be discussing Lean methedology in this post.I would recommend lean startup by “Eric ries” [link] if you havent read it yet .The things I will be sharing here are my own observations and my personal understanding of some imporant points when discussed wit respect to a startup.

### Learning
if thats the cake you love then you are at the right bakery shop.You will always have an opportunity in a startup to learn new things.Most of which is on the technological front, many tech starups rely on open source technologies, many of them have a research aspect associated with their work.You will not only gain many technical skills in a short span of time but more importantly you will know “how to learn and what to  learn and more imporantly what not to learn”.

### Enterpreneurship
You will have all round development of your skills not just on a technical front, but on buisness and personal aswell.You will learn how buisness  works and you will network with future collaborators most of them are intellegently crazy people( you have to be crazy to start a startup at the first place). As you will work closely with an entrepreneuer you will learn how to build a company and/or product, for someone who wants to start one of his/her own it can be of great importance as entrepreneurship is not taught but it can learned. You will be forced to try new things.

### Rapidly Adoption
Startup is a game whose rules will change everyday rather (I may be exageratting now) every hour or minute, so one has to adapt to the changes very rapidly.So a starup environment is chaotic and volatile and you need to adapt rapidly.Every day is hard yet differernt from one another. Your job description and/or designation changes faster then you expect it to be.

> Steve blank, a professor at Stanford and founder of several companies asks those intrested in joining a startup "How comfortable are you with chaos?".

###  Lots of work
There is lot of work which you have to complete within a specified amount.Occasilnally there will be some stress but at the same time if you love and are proud of what you are doing then it shouldn't be an issue, although you will be pushed to your limits.

### Passion
Alhtough you may be workaholic or of competitve nature but that will not cut it.You got to have Passion for the thing which you are doing so thats why you have to be very selective about what you want to do and when you want to do.They say that “No company is for everyone“.If you are not passionate about what you do then you are wasting your time and life is too short to do that.

### Less money
Although many rich people are entreprneurs or have been at some point of time, it is not recommended to join a startup if you want to earn huge amount of cash or if you are not comfortable with risks.

>In 2012 The Wall Street Journal reported that three out of four startups fail (75%),research conducted from 2004 to 2010 examning 2000 companies that had received at least $1 million in funding.

although there are many exceptions to this too some well funded startups will pay you well or provide you the option for shares or some other catchy benifits

### Know your-self
In startup you will explore everthing even about your self.You learn, enjoy,succeed, ask for help and accept failures.If you are not optimistic then you will become one.How you approach problems will change

### Output over Outfit
what you wear is not an issue, but productivity is very imporant.You have to contribute continously.

>As Enterpreneur David Bluhm notes “All start-up people need to be 'buisness builders' versus single contributors and view building the processes around their job as a primary role of the job itself”.

### Culture
Big companies and firms want to have a startup culture.In most of the startup the culture is filled with fun, adventure, sometimes pranks and cutoms.In startups fitting into the startup's culture (which varies from company to company )is very important as you have very small teams .If you face any issues with the company culture it will cause issues at some stage.

### Risk
Last but not the least startup involve risk, learing about risk , taking risks , encouraging risks “it is a messy mission that could fail or change the world”.So one should have goodwill and deep relationship with his/her company.It is always great to have that emotional ownership associated with your company as that will encourage to work hard and thus improve your self.

It is aleady a long post so I will conclude by saying that if you love innovation and are not afraid of challenges then you should consider joining a startup.(Footnote for students if you don't have a great cgpa don't worry, forget about cgpa if you dont even have a degree but are passionate and have skills you can easily get accomodated in a startup)

In short I would say working in a startup can be more than a job it can be a life changing experience

Note that I dont have an MBA so use the advise at your own risk !, Moreover I would love to hear from you if you have any comments of suggestions.
