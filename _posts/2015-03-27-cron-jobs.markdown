### cron job commands

`crontab -l` #to check cron jobs on your debian
`crontab -r` #to remove
`crontab -e` #to edit

### simple example in virtualenv
enter full path to the file where you want to store your logs. e.g

`* * * * * echo ‘Run this command every minute’ >> /home/aameer/Documents/projects/project_name/logs/file.log 2>&1`

Python version to be used has also to be mentioned, we can check it by runnig following file(say crontest.py) with a cron job

{% highlight python linenos %}
import sys
print ("-"*100)
print ("Python Version used")
print (sys.version)
print ("Minute over")
{% endhighlight %}

`* * * * * python /home/aameer/Documents/projects/project_name/crontest.py >> /home/aameer/Documents/projects/project_name/logs/file.log 2>&1`

#Moreover to start or stop a cron job 
`sudo service cron start`
`sudo service cron stop`

#to use different python version we provide path
~/.virtualenvs/project_name/bin/python3.4 /home/aameer/Documents/projects/project_name/crontest.py >> /home/aameer/Documents/projects/project_name/logs/file.log 2>&1

# for all of these commands we can check the output in the file.log.
